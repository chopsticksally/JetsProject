## Jets Project

### Week 2 Homework for Skill Distillery

### What I did:
1. Create an abstract superclass called Jets.
2. The Jets class has getters and setters in order for the subclasses to inherit private fields.
3. Create subclasses that will extend the superclass and inherit the fields of the superclass. 
4. Create 2 interfaces implemented by the concrete subclasses.
5. Create an Airfield that will house an array of Jets and initialize 5 jets.
6. Create a JetApp with a main method that calls a launch method.
7. Your JetApp displays the menu and houses all methods that can be called by the displayed menu.
8. Create a JetImpl class that will allow user generated jets to be created and added to the Jets array in the airfield.


### What i learned
1. I had trouble initializing the scanner at first and realized I had to import it outside of main in order for it to be utilized by other methods.
2. while iterating through the jets array i had to check for nulls in order to avoid a null pointer exception. 
3. for Dogfight and load cargo menu options i had to identify the appropriate class of jet and cast that entry in the array so that the method could be called.
4. using arrays as arguments, parameters and returns was super challenging.
5. i added the speedInMach method but didnt see where it was going to be used so i never called it.
6.Google is your friend!!!
